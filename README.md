# Python Sysadmin Katas

Tiny, practical scripts for IT tasks — files, logs, networks, and APIs.  
Each kata is standalone, safe to run locally, and designed for quick 10–15 minute sessions.

**Purpose:** build daily automation fluency for Windows/M365 and security operations.

> New katas added weekly as part of ongoing IT practice.
