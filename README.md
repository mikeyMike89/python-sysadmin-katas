# Python Sysadmin Katas

Tiny, practical scripts for IT and sysadmin tasks — files, logs, networks, and APIs.  
Each kata is standalone, safe to run locally, and designed for quick 10–15 minute sessions.

**Goal:** build daily automation fluency for Windows/M365 and security operations.

## 🗂️ Structure
| Folder | Focus | Example Script |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `00-basics` | Python fundamentals for sysadmins | `print_paths.py` |
| `01-files` | File and folder automation | `bulk_rename_prefix.py` |
| `02-text-logs` | Searching, parsing, and filtering text or logs | `grep_like.py` |
| `03-networking` | Network utilities and IP tools | `subnet_calc.py` |

> New katas are added weekly as part of a structured automation practice.
